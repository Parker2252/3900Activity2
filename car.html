<p>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on the automotive industry. With advancements in AI technology, cars are becoming smarter, safer, and more efficient.
</p>
<p>
  One notable application of AI in cars is autonomous driving. AI algorithms and sensors enable self-driving cars to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate through complex road conditions. This technology holds the promise of reducing accidents, optimizing traffic flow, and providing increased mobility for individuals who are unable to drive.
</p>
<p>
  AI also plays a significant role in improving vehicle safety. AI-based systems can analyze real-time data from cameras and sensors to detect potential hazards, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or obstacles. These systems can then assist the driver by providing warnings or even taking control to prevent accidents.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, AI enhances the driving experience through features like advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). ADAS technologies utilize AI algorithms to provide adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assistance, and automatic emergency braking. These features make driving more convenient, comfortable, and reduce driver fatigue.
